# npm resolution error report

While resolving: weather-dashboard@0.1.0
Found: lucide-react@0.483.0
node_modules/lucide-react
  lucide-react@"^0.323.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
lucide-react@"^0.323.0" from the root project

Conflicting peer dependency: react@18.3.1
node_modules/react
  peer react@"^16.5.1 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from lucide-react@0.323.0
  node_modules/lucide-react
    lucide-react@"^0.323.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
